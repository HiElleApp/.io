If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the Dispute will be exclusively brought in federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal judicial district of your residence.</span></li><li class="c3 c8 c17"><span class="c1 c9">Miscellaneous Terms.</span></li><li class="c3 c6 c17"><span class="c4">No Joint Venture or Agency Relationship</span><span class="c0">.
